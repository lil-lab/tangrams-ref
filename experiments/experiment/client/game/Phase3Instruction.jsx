          <p>That's it for the main phase of the study!</p>
          <p>
            We just have a few more questions before you go. Now that you've
            gotten to know your partner a bit, we're interested in your ability
            to communicate about a new set of pictures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the previous phase, you will take turns as Speaker and
            Listener, but now you will only be able to send <strong>one</strong>{" "}
            message as the Speaker, instead of chatting freely, and you will no
            longer receive feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final phase will start automatically in 30 secondsâ€¦ Good luck!
          </p>
